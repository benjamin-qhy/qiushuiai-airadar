**Design QA**

- Source visual truth: `/Users/qiushui/.codex/visualizations/2026/09/14/01a0a063-c1b8-78b0-95d2-7f51f4c030f4/aisocial-reference-with-card-1248x720.png`
- Implementation screenshot: `/Users/qiushui/.codex/visualizations/2026/09/14/01a0a063-c1b8-78b0-95d2-7f51f4c030f4/airadar-reference-style-final-v2.png`
- Detail interaction screenshot: `/Users/qiushui/.codex/visualizations/2026/09/14/01a0a063-c1b8-78b0-95d2-7f51f4c030f4/airadar-reference-style-detail.png`
- Combined comparison: `/Users/qiushui/.codex/visualizations/2026/09/14/01a0a063-c1b8-78b0-95d2-7f51f4c030f4/airadar-design-comparison-final.png`
- Viewport: desktop, 1280 x 720 CSS pixels, light theme.
- Pixels and density: source 1280 x 720, implementation 1280 x 720, captured at the same browser density with no normalization required. The detail capture is 1269 x 714 because the in-app panel chrome resized the tab after interaction.
- State: source AI 精选 page with one representative card; implementation 每日精选 page with two persisted real items. The reference backend was unavailable, so the source capture used one temporary representative card populated from the same real AI Radar item. The reference source directory was not modified.

**Full-view comparison evidence**

- The combined comparison confirms the same 256px navigation rail, 64px single-row filter header, pale active states, dense seven-column desktop grid, light borders, 8px card radius, and high whitespace content canvas.
- The retained differences are intentional product constraints: AI Radar keeps its own navigation labels, score, topics, actions, real-data notice, and master-detail workflow.

**Focused region comparison evidence**

- Header: category tabs, platform selection, recommendation/status tabs, search, and compact control sizing follow the source hierarchy and spacing.
- Card: both use a 3:4 cover, top AI status treatment, AI text over the image, bottom source/date gradient, compact title, metrics, a light border, and a subtle hover fill.
- Detail: opening the first card was tested and produced the retained 38/62 list/detail split with real media and metadata. This intentionally replaces the source dialog.

**Findings**

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 visual mismatch remains.
- P3: AI Radar media cards are slightly taller because topics and persistent project actions are retained below the title.
- P3: the reference capture shows an unrelated backend error toast; it was excluded from fidelity judgment.

**Required fidelity surfaces**

- Fonts and typography: system UI fallback preserves the source-like size, weight, line height, truncation, and hierarchy while avoiding an external-font white-screen failure.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: sidebar, header, grid gaps, cover ratio, radius, borders, and content padding match the source structure.
- Colors and visual tokens: neutral gray canvas, pale selected states, white cards, subtle borders, gradients, and black/white overlays are aligned.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the implementation uses persisted source media URLs with object-cover cropping; no placeholder or synthetic asset was introduced.
- Copy and content: AI Radar product labels and real content are intentionally retained.

**Comparison history**

1. First pass findings: selected tabs were too dark, card radius was too large, the header scrollbar was visible, and AI summaries made media cards unnecessarily tall.
2. Fixes: changed selected tabs to pale gray, reduced cards to 8px radius, hid the header scrollbar, switched to natural-height grid items, and moved media summaries into the cover overlay.
3. Post-fix evidence: `airadar-reference-style-final-v2.png` and `airadar-design-comparison-final.png`; no actionable P0/P1/P2 mismatch remains.

**Primary interactions tested**

- Initial page load with persisted real data.
- Content card open into the 38/62 detail split.
- Real cover image and interaction counts rendered.
- Browser console errors checked: none in the implementation.

**Implementation Checklist**

- [x] Reference-style shell, header, filters, cards, and density.
- [x] Existing AI Radar elements and real-data behavior retained.
- [x] Detail split interaction retained and verified.
- [x] Full build, tests, and browser console verification completed.

final result: passed
